Historically, gold had been used as a form of currency in various parts of the world including USA. In present times, precious metals like gold are held with central banks of all countries to guarantee re-payment of foreign debts, and also to control inflation which results in reflecting the financial strength of the country.

Forecasting rise and fall in the daily gold rates, can help investors to decide when to buy (or sell) the commodity.
